# Movied

A Flutter 2 project and TMDB API.

## What is it?

This is a minimalistic app that you should use to search for movies, see what's popular/upcoming and most importantly, check their rating.

It uses The Movie Data Base free API.

P.S: The api keys are not in git, so you shouldn't be able to run the code, to do so, register at TMDB, and place a folder inside assets called config and a main.json with your api key.
